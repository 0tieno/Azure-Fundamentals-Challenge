## Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals.

## What is Azure Fundamentals?
Azure Fundamentals is a series of three learning paths that familiarize you with Azure and its many services and features.

## Why should I take Azure Fundamentals?
If you're just beginning to work with the cloud, or if you already have cloud experience, Azure Fundamentals provides you with everything you need to get started.

No matter your goals, Azure Fundamentals has something for you. You should take this course if you:
- Have general interest in Azure or in cloud computing.
- Want to earn official certification from Microsoft (AZ-900).

## Module 01: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you’ll be able to:
- Define cloud computing.
- Describe the shared responsibility model.
- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
- Describe the consumption-based model.
- Compare cloud pricing models.

### What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

### Describe the Shared Responsibility Model
When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:
- The information and data stored in the cloud.
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on).
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization.

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
- The physical datacenter.
- The physical network.
- The physical hosts.

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
- Operating systems.
- Network controls.
- Applications.
- Identity and infrastructure.

### Define Cloud Models
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.

#### Private Cloud
A private cloud is a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department.

#### Public Cloud
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. Anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

#### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment. It allows a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.

### Describe the Consumption-Based Model
When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider: Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).

- **CapEx**: A one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources (e.g., a new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle).
- **OpEx**: Spending money on services or products over time (e.g., renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services).

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because it operates on a consumption-based model. You pay for the IT resources you use, with no upfront costs and no need to manage costly infrastructure.

### Compare Cloud Pricing Models
Cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
- Plan and manage your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.

## Module 02: Describe the Benefits of Using Cloud Services

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:
- Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

### Introduction
In this module, you’ll be introduced to some of the benefits that cloud computing offers. You’ll learn how cloud computing can help you meet variable demand while providing a good experience for your customer. You’ll also learn about security, governance, and overall manageability in the cloud.

### Describe the Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud

#### High Availability
High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service.

#### Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal.

- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding or subtracting the number of resources.

### Describe the Benefits of Reliability and Predictability in the Cloud

#### Reliability
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.

#### Predictability
Predictability in the cloud includes performance predictability and cost predictability.

- **Performance Predictability**: Predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers.
- **Cost Predictability**: Predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.

### Describe the Benefits of Security and Governance in the Cloud
Cloud features support governance and compliance, ensuring that all deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance and provides mitigation strategies.

### Describe the Benefits of Manageability in the Cloud

#### Management of the Cloud
Managing your cloud resources includes:
- Automatically scaling resource deployment based on need.
- Deploying resources based on preconfigured templates.
- Monitoring the health of resources.
- Receiving automatic alerts based on configured metrics.

#### Management in the Cloud
Managing your cloud environment and resources can be done through:
- A web portal.
- A command line interface.
- APIs.
- PowerShell.

## Module 03: Describe Cloud Service Types

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, you'll be able to:
- Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- Describe Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- Describe Software as a Service (SaaS).
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

### Describe Infrastructure as a Service
With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

#### Scenarios
Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:
- Lift-and-shift migration: Setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter and then moving the on-prem operations to the IaaS infrastructure.
- Testing and development: Rapidly replicating established configurations for development and test environments.

### Describe Platform as a Service
Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

### Describe Software as a Service
Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. It involves renting or using a fully developed application.

#### Scenarios
Some common scenarios for SaaS are:
- Email and collaboration: Using a full-featured email and calendar solution.
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP): Using a suite of business apps.

# Module04: Azure Compute and Networking Features

## Overview

This provides an overview of three key compute options in Azure: Virtual Machines (VMs), Containers, and Azure Functions. It also covers essential networking features such as Azure Virtual Networks, Azure DNS, and Azure ExpressRoute.

## Azure Compute Options

### Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Description**: VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways.
- **Use Cases**:
  - During testing and development
  - Running applications in the cloud
  - Extending your datacenter to the cloud
  - During disaster recovery

### Azure Containers

- **Description**: Containers provide a virtualization environment to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine. Unlike VMs, containers do not require managing the operating system.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for running multiple instances of an application efficiently on a single physical or virtual host.

### Azure Functions

- **Description**: Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that eliminates the need to maintain VMs or containers. It runs your code when triggered by events and automatically deallocates resources after execution.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic scaling based on demand
  - Charged only for the CPU time during function execution
  - Stateless or stateful (Durable Functions) options
  - Core component of serverless computing

## Azure Networking Features

### Azure Virtual Networks

- **Description**: Azure Virtual Networks and subnets allow Azure resources to communicate with each other, internet users, and on-premises computers, effectively extending your on-premises network.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Isolation and segmentation
  - Internet communications
  - Communication between Azure resources and with on-premises resources
  - Route and filter network traffic
  - Connect multiple virtual networks

### Azure Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

- **Description**: A VPN uses an encrypted tunnel within another network, typically connecting two or more trusted private networks over an untrusted network (like the public internet).
- **VPN Gateways**:
  - Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks (site-to-site)
  - Connect individual devices to virtual networks (point-to-site)
  - Connect virtual networks to each other (network-to-network)
  - Data transfer is encrypted within a private tunnel.

## Conclusion

Understanding these Azure compute and networking features helps in deploying scalable, secure, and efficient cloud solutions tailored to your business needs.
